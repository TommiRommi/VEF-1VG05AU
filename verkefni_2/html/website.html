		<li class="the_bad_things">Program should <span style="color:red">never</span> execute outside of program space.</li>
		<ul class="list_body">
			The program can't stop, it will continue to execute forever and ever. 
			To stop a program from causing a disaster, the program counter needs 
			to be trapped in a endless loop.
		</ul>

		<li class="the_bad_things"><span style="color:red">Never</span> run undocumented opcodes unless you know what you are doing.</li>
		<ul class=list_body>
			Running undocemented opcodes can lead undefined code behavior and bugs.
			In the worst case undefined opcodes can lock up the CPU,
			cause a bus overload, and jam the pipeline
		</ul>

		<li class="the_bad_things"><span style="color:red">Never</span> use a computer component without it being properly initlized.</li>
		<ul class="list_body">
			most components on a computer need to be initlized before you can
			properly use them, unless it can cause undefined behavior. Initlization
			is done via something know as bootcode/IPL or for more complicated 
			machines BIOS. Refer to the components datasheet for more info.
