The leaves of autumn fall so slow,
As if they hesitate to go,
But go they must, the time is nigh,
And leave the trees to winter's sky.
		</div>
		<div>
The wind whispers secrets in my ear,
Of distant lands and dreams so clear,
And I close my eyes and let it take me,
To places where my soul can be free.
		</div>
		<div>
The nightingale sings a melody sweet,
That echoes through the night so complete,
And as I listen to its soothing sound,
My troubles and worries are nowhere to be found.
		</div>
		<div>
The sunset paints the sky with gold,
A beauty that never gets old,
And as the day comes to an end,
I am grateful for the moments spent.

		<div>
The morning dew sparkles like diamonds bright,
As it clings to the leaves in the morning light,
And for a moment all the world seems new,
Bathed in the beauty of the morning dew.
		</div>
		<div>
The rose in all its splendor rare,
Beneath the sun's warm golden glare,
Reveals its beauty to the world,
As its petals gracefully unfurled.
		</div>
		<div>
The mountain stands so tall and proud,
Its peak obscured by a misty cloud,
And as I stand beneath its majesty,
I feel small in its enormity.
		</div>
		<div>
The starry sky above so high,
A canvas painted in the night sky,
And as I search for a shooting star,
I know that dreams can take us far.
		</div>

	<section class="media_3">
		<div>
The ocean calls with a voice so grand,
Its waves crashing on the shore like a band,
And I am drawn to its endless expanse,
To find peace in its rhythmic dance.
		</div>
		<div>
A new day dawns with the rising sun,
A fresh start for everyone,
And I welcome the light with open arms,
As the world awakens to its charms.
		</div>
		<div>
The butterfly flits from flower to flower,
Its wings a rainbow in the sun's power,
And as I watch its graceful dance,
I am lost in its beauty and romance.
		</div>
		<div>
The moonlit night is a sight to see,
A symphony of light and mystery,
And as I gaze upon its silver glow,
I feel my spirit start to grow.
